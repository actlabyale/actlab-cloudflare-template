Deploy with https://github.com/cloudflare/pages-action

AFAICT, need to do an initial link on the cloudflare site. Then disable auto-deploy (which will happen via github actions, instead of built-in cloudflare build step)

Set the custom URL to something (e.g. actlab-cloudflare-template.actlab.dev)
